# Rehabilitation Product Strategy & Prototype

This repository contains the strategic planning and initial prototypes for building software-based rehabilitation tools using off-the-shelf consumer hardware.

## Contents

*   **[Product Strategy](docs/REHAB_PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md):** Detailed breakdown of market opportunity, technology stack, and product concepts.
*   **[Mobile Migration Guide](docs/MOBILE_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md):** How to move from Python prototypes to iOS/Android apps.
*   **Prototypes:** Python implementations of motion tracking algorithms.

## Goals

1.  Demonstrate feasibility of using MediaPipe for real-time physical therapy feedback.
2.  Develop low-cost, high-accessibility solutions for home rehabilitation.
3.  Create a scalable software architecture for remote patient monitoring.

## Getting Started (Prototype)

1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r prototypes/requirements.txt
    ```
2.  Run the Pose Estimator:
    ```bash
    python prototypes/pose_estimator.py
    ```
