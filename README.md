# Rehabilitation Product Strategy & Prototype

This repository contains the strategic planning and initial prototypes for building software-based rehabilitation tools using off-the-shelf consumer hardware.

## Contents

*   **[Product Strategy](docs/REHAB_PRODUCT_STRATEGY.md):** Detailed breakdown of market opportunity, technology stack, and product concepts.
*   **Prototypes:** (Coming Soon) Python and Web-based implementations of motion tracking algorithms.

## Goals

1.  Demonstrate feasibility of using MediaPipe for real-time physical therapy feedback.
2.  Develop low-cost, high-accessibility solutions for home rehabilitation.
3.  Create a scalable software architecture for remote patient monitoring.
