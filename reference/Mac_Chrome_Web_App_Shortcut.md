# How to Create a Web App Shortcut in Chrome on Mac

To turn a website into a standalone web app shortcut (PWA) on your Mac using Google Chrome, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Website**
   Open Chrome and go to the website you want to turn into an app.

2. **Open the Chrome Menu**
   Click on the three vertical dots (`⋮`) in the top-right corner of the browser window.

3. **Select "Create Shortcut"**
   - Go to **Cast, Save and Share** (or **More Tools** in some versions).
   - Select **Create Shortcut...**.
   - *Note: If the site is a Progressive Web App (PWA), you might see "Install [App Name]..." directly in the menu or in the address bar.*

4. **Configure the Shortcut**
   - A dialog box will appear.
   - Name your shortcut.
   - **Crucial Step:** Check the box that says **"Open as window"**. This ensures it opens in its own window without the browser interface (address bar, tabs), making it feel like a native app.

5. **Create**
   Click the **Create** button.

6. **Add to Dock (Optional)**
   - A Finder window should automatically open displaying the new shortcut (usually located in your `~/Applications/Chrome Apps` folder).
   - You can drag this icon to your Dock for easy access.
   - You can also find it later in Launchpad or via Spotlight Search.
