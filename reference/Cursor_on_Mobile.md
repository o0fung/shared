# Cursor AI on Mobile (iOS)

Currently, **Cursor does not have a dedicated native mobile app** for iOS or Android.

Since your goal is to ask **general questions** (not coding tasks requiring repo access) on your iPhone, here are the best approaches:

## 1. Recommended: Use Native AI Apps
If you want to access high-end models (like Gemini Pro, GPT-4, or Claude 3.5 Sonnet) for general chat without creating Git branches, the best experience on iPhone is to use the official apps for those models.

*   **Google App / Gemini App**: Good for using Gemini models directly.
*   **ChatGPT App**: Excellent mobile interface for GPT-4o.
*   **Claude (Web/PWA)**: Anthropic has a great mobile web interface (and an iOS app) for Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

**Why?**
*   No "Git branch" overhead.
*   Better mobile UI (designed for touch).
*   Faster load times than the heavy Cursor Web Agent.

## 2. Workaround: Cursor Web Agent on Mobile Safari
You *can* technically continue using the page you bookmarked (`https://cursor.com/agents`) on mobile Safari/Chrome.
*   **Pros**: Has context of your repo if you really need it.
*   **Cons**: As you noted, it creates "junk" branches for every conversation. The UI is also denser and harder to use on a small screen compared to a native chat app.

## Summary
For **general questions** on the go, stop using Cursor. Use the **ChatGPT** or **Google** iOS apps. Return to Cursor (Desktop) when you need to actually write code.
